I was reading mashable in web archive to see how pete cashmore blogs when he start.
I found something amazing:
[The Mobile Phone: The Most Important Invention Ever?](http://mashable.com/2005/09/15/the-mobile-phone-the-most-important-invention-ever/ "The mobile phone: The most important inventiom ever?").  

You can see, this was posted 2 years before the iPhone release. He is noticing this from other people but is amazing how the community already knows what was coming in the next years, it's likely they build all of what we have today.  

I see in that post a vision of how he imagine the future, a vision of what will change our lives. I see this type of comunications in every lider and important person in the world. From elon musk to Jack Dorsey or even Spiegel.  

I think it is importan to start to think in our vision or perceive others visions. Even if it is not formalized the visions are there and you can perceive them. Visions are related with the ideas, ideas does not have face but when you read history you can not understand a message if you don't know who is the messenger. 

I don't want to become a million community blog, but i want to have a blog that will remains and can contribute to people knowledge.
