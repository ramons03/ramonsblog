Refit is a library heavily inspired by Square's Retrofit library, and it turns your REST API into a live interface:
```cs 
public interface IGitHubApi
{
    [Get("/users/{user}")]
    Task<User> GetUser(string user);
}
``` 

The RestService class generates an implementation of IGitHubApi that uses HttpClient to make its calls:
```cs 
var gitHubApi = RestService.For<IGitHubApi>("https://api.github.com");
var octocat = await gitHubApi.GetUser("octocat");
```  
.NET Core supports registering via HttpClientFactory 

``` cs
services
    .AddRefitClient<IGitHubApi>()
    .ConfigureHttpClient(c => c.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://api.github.com"));
```
