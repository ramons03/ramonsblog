PRPL is a pattern for structuring and serving Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), with an emphasis on the performance of app delivery and launch. It stands for:

* **Push** critical resources for the initial URL route.
* **Render** initial route.
* **Pre-cache** remaining routes.
* **Lazy-load** and create remaining routes on demand.
