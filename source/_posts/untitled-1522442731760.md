A microframework is a term used to refer to minimalistic web application frameworks. It is contrasted with full-stack frameworks. 
It lacks most of the functionality which is common to expect in a full-fledged web application framework, such as:
* Accounts, authentication, authorization, roles, etc.
* Database abstraction via an object-relational mapping.
* Input validation and input sanitation.
* Web template engine.
