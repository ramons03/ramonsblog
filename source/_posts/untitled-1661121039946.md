HTTP Logging is a middleware that logs information about HTTP requests and HTTP responses. HTTP logging provides logs of:

HTTP request information
Common properties
Headers
Body
HTTP response information
HTTP Logging is valuable in several scenarios to:

Record information about incoming requests and responses.
Filter which parts of the request and response are logged.
Filtering which headers to log.
HTTP Logging can reduce the performance of an app, especially when logging the request and response bodies. Consider the performance impact when selecting fields to log. Test the performance impact of the selected logging properties.
