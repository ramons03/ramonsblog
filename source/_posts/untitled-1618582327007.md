### Relevant answes:
If you want to exclude a sensitive case column like the password for example, I do this to hide the value : 

```sql
SELECT * , "" as password FROM tableName;
``` 

A modern SQL dialect like BigQuery proposes an excellent solution
```sql
SELECT * EXCEPT(ColumnNameX, [ColumnNameY, ...])
``` 

This is a very powerful SQL syntax to avoid a long list of columns that need to be updated all the time due to table column name changes.

You could create a view that has the columns you wish to select, then you can just select * from the view.
