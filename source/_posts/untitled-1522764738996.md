In object-oriented programming, the safe navigation operator (also known as optional chaining operator, safe call operator, null-conditional operator, null-coalescing operator, null-aware operator or null propagation operator) is a binary operator that returns its second argument but null if the first argument is null. It is used to avoid sequential explicit null checks and assignments and replace them with method/property chaining. In programming languages where the navigation operator (e.g. ".") leads to an error if applied to a null object, the safe navigation operator stops the evaluation of a method/field chain and returns null as the value of the chain expression.

In C# 6.0 and above, basic null-conditional operators ?. and ?[]:[9]
