In C# 3.0 and later, auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the property accessors. They also enable client code to create objects. When you declare a property as shown in the following example, the compiler creates a private, anonymous backing field that can only be accessed through the property's get and set accessors. In C# 9 and later, init accessors can also be declared as auto-implemented properties.

```cs 
// This class is mutable. Its data can be modified from
// outside the class.
class Customer
{
    // Auto-implemented properties for trivial get and set
    public double TotalPurchases { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int CustomerId { get; set; }

    // Constructor
    public Customer(double purchases, string name, int id)
    {
        TotalPurchases = purchases;
        Name = name;
        CustomerId = id;
    }

    // Methods
    public string GetContactInfo() { return "ContactInfo"; }
    public string GetTransactionHistory() { return "History"; }

    // .. Additional methods, events, etc.
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Intialize a new object.
        Customer cust1 = new Customer(4987.63, "Northwind", 90108);

        // Modify a property.
        cust1.TotalPurchases += 499.99;
    }
}
```
