Is a binary operator that is part of the syntax for a basic conditional expression in several programming languages, the null coalescing operator generally returns the result of its left-most operand if it exists and is not null, and otherwise returns the right-most operand. This behavior allows a default value to be defined for cases where a more specific value is not available.

```csharp 
string pageTitle = suppliedTitle ?? "Default Title";
```
